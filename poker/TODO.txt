- Implement bucketing (abstract the game tree)
- Finish cfr game: interfaces with the base version - how we will update our information set
- Finish cfr implementation

- Try and train? Will probably not be possible
- Optimise - MCCFR? Pruning unlikely branches...

I think the event driven is better for the ai as well
we want to decide on an action -> apply it to a game state -> get a new game state back

right now the hs2 bucketing is working on 100 iterations per state, 
which will be run probably over 10 million times. not good. precompute?
the literature on this is sparse. 

need to consider training the pre-flop, flop, turn etc seperately. Idk how this would work though
